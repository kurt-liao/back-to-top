# Back To Top

A chrome extension that inject a back-to-top button in every web page.

## ❗Important

The source is release, but the extension is still review by Google.
For the reason, you can clone this repo and load unpacked extension in **chrome://extensions** and use it locally.

## Motivation

Sometimes when I reading some articles from some web, there's no back-to-top button for me to scroll top instantly.
For the inconvenient reason, I create this extension that inject a back-to-top button if the page has scrollbar.

## TODOs

- [x] Main feature - Injected back-to-top button with scroll top function.
- [ ] Support on/off manually.
- [ ] Support custom styles of button settings from option page.
